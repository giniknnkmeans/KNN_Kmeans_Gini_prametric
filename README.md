# KNN and K-means in Gini Prametric Spaces

## Description

This project introduces innovative enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms by leveraging the concept of Gini prametric spaces. Unlike traditional distance metrics, Gini prametrics combine value-based and rank-based measures, offering greater robustness to noise and outliers. Key contributions of this work include:

1. Proposing a novel Gini prametric that integrates rank information alongside value distances.
2. Developing a Gini K-means algorithm that guarantees convergence and demonstrates resilience to noisy data.
3. Introducing a Gini KNN method that rivals state-of-the-art approaches, such as Hassanatâ€™s distance, particularly in noisy environments.

Extensive experimental evaluations on 14 datasets from the UCI repository showcase the superior performance and efficiency of Gini-based algorithms in clustering and classification tasks. This project opens new avenues for leveraging rank-based prametrics in machine learning and statistical analysis.

## Usage

An example on how to use KNN, Kmeans and Hierarchical Clustering is given in the KNN.py, Kmeans.py and hierarchical_clustering.py files.
First, you will have to activate the gini_env that you created earlier on and then you can execute the files.
